Build/Run Code: `clear && dune clean && dune build && dune runtest`

Functionality:
- All general features implemented and thoroughly tested (new interface usage demonstrated in unit tests)
- Non-essential features also implemented including read(), string printing, and pre/post increment/decrement

Exceptional Behavior:
- Interface redesign. Notable changes include moving Assign to Expr from Statement and adding some new types.
- Type expr represents a type evaluable to a float while type statement represents a top-level expression (that may wrap expr)
- We don't enforce "assignment;comparison;assignment" in loops by design, users are free to use any numeric expressions ("expr;expr;expr")
- Invalid characters (non-double) will terminate the program on a read() operation.
