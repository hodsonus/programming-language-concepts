COP4020 Spring 2019
Polynomial Simplification
John Hodson
Christian Marin

Running Code:
Run code using `make tests`
New tests incuded in tests directory will automatically be run

Features Completed:
All required features implemented
No extra credit was attempted

Output Interpretation:
The original parsed output will appear in the first line of the output file
Every following line represents one iteration of the simplification algorithm
After two iterations are found identical, simplification is determined to have converged
Finally, another top level function will once more print the final output (third appearance)
