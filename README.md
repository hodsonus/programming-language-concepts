Programming Language Concepts

This was the repository that was used for the duration of my enrollment in COP4020 -
Programming Language Concepts with Professor Alin Dobra at the University of Florida.

A variety of projects were completed and I gained exposure to compilers, interpreters,
AST manipulation, and the tools associated with these concepts. We used ANTLR4 and java
for these kinds of problems.

Exposure to functional programming was also achieved. Professor Dobra talked about concepts
associated with functional programming and demonstrated with OCaml tutorials in class. Most
of the code that was written in class was with OCaml.

We also gained exposure to logic programming. Our second-to-last project was written in
Prolog, with the goal of mimicking the type inference mechanism that OCaml uses to type code.
