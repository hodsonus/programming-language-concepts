Run Code: (using grun resting rig)
antlr4 ./Grammar.g4
javac Grammar*.java
grun Grammar exprList ./test.bc

Functionality:
- All mandatory features are functional.
- Extra credit was not attempted.

Exceptional Behavior:
- Print function was implemented using Java println() rather than print() by design.
- Modulus was implemented simply using the integer `%` operator without scaling for floats/doubles.
- Depending on the system, un/comment line 180 to properly parse escape characters in print strings.
- Invalid characters (non-double) will terminate the program on a read() operation.
- Taking a square root or log of a negative number will result in NaN.
