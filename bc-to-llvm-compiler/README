Programming Language Concepts
Professor Alin Dobra

A lot of features are working - but not all. Basic arithmetic, functions, for loops, if statements, and print statements all work.
However, I was unable to get while loops and recursion working. I don't need the credit for this assignment and completed it for 
the sake of learning and to show to Professor Dobra.

To run my OCaml LLVM generator, compile the LLVM with clang, and run the compiled program, simply call "make" from the project root.
All output will be printed to the standard console.
