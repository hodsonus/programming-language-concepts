Buidl/Run Code: `make`

Functionality:
- 

Exceptional Behavior:
- We dont have "assignment comparison assignment" in our for loops, rather, "numeric numeric numeric"
- Constant value propagation is implemented.

- Print function was implemented using Java println() rather than print() by design.
- Modulus was implemented simply using the integer `%` operator without scaling for floats/doubles.
- Depending on the system, un/comment line 180 to properly parse escape characters in print strings.
- Invalid characters (non-double) will terminate the program on a read() operation.
- Taking a square root or log of a negative number will result in NaN.
