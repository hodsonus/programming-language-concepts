Run Code: (using grun resting rig)
antlr4 ./Grammar.g4 && javac Grammar*.java && grun Grammar exprList ./test.bc

clear && antlr4 -o ./bin/ ./Grammar.g4 && javac *.java -d ./bin/ && javac ./bin/*.java -d ./bin/
1. Clear the console
2. Generate ANTLR4 .java files into the ./bin/ directory
3. Compile the .java files in the root project directory (the AST nodes) into the ./bin/ folder
4. Compile the .java files in the ./bin/ folder (the files that the ANTLR4 tool generated)

Functionality:
- 

Exceptional Behavior:
- Print function was implemented using Java println() rather than print() by design.
- Modulus was implemented simply using the integer `%` operator without scaling for floats/doubles.
- Depending on the system, un/comment line 180 to properly parse escape characters in print strings.
- Invalid characters (non-double) will terminate the program on a read() operation.
- Taking a square root or log of a negative number will result in NaN.
